This is a little game to play hangman with a simple set of possible words.  
This is mostly to help brush off some dust from my memory when it comes to using Python.  
The code could be cleaned a bit up and more words could be used, but it's fine enough how it is I guess?  
I could also accommodate for sentences or phrases instead of just words so that I could play Wheel of Fortune.  Maybe that's what I could do for next time?
